## Motivation
- The IDEs didn’t change much, except for syntax highlighting and debugging features.
- Everything changed dramatically with the arrival of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.
- In natural language, I asked ChatGPT to write code. Or in VS Code, I would type a fragment of a function, and GitHub Copilot would generate a code block. 
- The real power was that these tools could handle many of the tedious tasks for developers.
- Turns out, these AI tools are handy for more than just coding. 
- I began using ChatGPT for 
  - brainstorming app ideas, 
  - drafting requirements, 
  - unit tests. 
- It didn’t take long for me to be convinced that AI-assisted programming would be one of those must-have skills for programmers. 
- AI-assisted programming is quickly evolving.

## What's Covered
- **Chapter 1, “New World for Developers”**: 
  - How generative AI is changing the game for coders. 
  - How these AI tools are helping developers think more about the big picture and less about the nitty-gritty of coding. 
  - The history of programming languages. 
- **Chapter 2, “How AI Coding Technology Works”**: 
  - explaining generative AI
  - why transformer models and large language models are big deals in the programming world. 
- **Chapter 3, “Prompt Engineering”**: 
  - Practical tips, like 
    - dealing with wordy or confusing prompts
    - deterring AI from making stuff up. 
  - It breaks down the key parts of a prompt and shows you how to use them effectively.
- **Chapter 4, “GitHub Copilot”**: 
  - The core features like creating code with comments, Chat, and using an AI-powered command-line interface. 
  - Customizing the system for proprietary codebases.
- **Chapter 5, “Other AI-Assisted Programming Tools”**: 
  - The other top AI-assisted programming tools
- **Chapter 6, “ChatGPT and Other General-Purpose LLMs”**:
  - How to use these tools for tasks like handling regular expressions, starter code, and GitHub Actions.
- **Chapter 7, “Ideas, Planning, and Requirements”**: 
  - Using chatbots to kick off software projects. 
  - This involves topics like 
    - brainstorming
    - market research
    - requirements documents
    - test-driven development
- **Chapter 8, “Coding”**: 
  - Common scenarios for development, whether working with APIs, using modular programming, or refactoring. 
  - Handling functions and object-oriented programming.
- **Chapter 9, “Debugging, Testing, and Deployment”**: 
  - fixing bugs, 
  - using AI-assisted programming tools for code reviews,
  - making unit tests, and 
  - describing pull requests.
- **Chapter 10, “Takeaways”**: 
  - This is a wrap-up of the book, emphasizing the main points.

## How This Book Is Different
- When you give a program certain input, you always get the same output. For ages, this pure deterministic logic was the heart and soul of software. 
- But when you use AI-assisted programming tools, things get a bit topsy-turvy. 
  - Getting results is like rolling dice since everything works on probabilities. 
  - When you prompt an AI tool to whip up some code, and even use the same prompt over multiple tries, you might get different results each time. 

## Who Should Read This Book
- This book is for any developer, whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been in the game for many years.

## Using Code Examples
- Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) is available for download at
- https://github.com/ttaulli/AI-Assisted-Programming-Book. 

## Permission
- In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. 
- Cases that does not require permission
  - Writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. 
  - Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. 
- Cases that need permission
  - Selling or distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. 
  - Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require
permission.

# I. Scientific Research and Its Purpose {background-color="aquamarine"}
![](_img/typeofknow.png)

## Not a Scientific Knowledge
- **Traditional Knowledge**: a form of knowledge inherited from the culture one grew up in
- **Authority**: a form of knowledge believed to be true because its source is authoritative, such as parents or teachers.
- **Experiential knowledge**: a form of knowledge gained through experiences


## Scientific Knowledge
- **Scientific knowledge**: a form of knowledge based on studies conducted by researchers; knowledge that can be trusted.
- New scientific knowledge is produced by systematic research
- Reality and knowledge are two different things
- Research is generated by following sets of rules, embodying skills, and following a framework to analyze results.

## Karl Popper’s Falsifiability
- Systematic attempts to prove things wrong advance scientific knowledge
- Empirical evidence: acquiring data or information by systematically observing people or events, i.e. practical experience.
- Falsified: proven an established theory wrong.

---

- PS1 is a problem situation or issue 
- To explain this problem, there are a number of tentative theories, or TT1. 
- If we try to falsify these tentative theories by error of elimination, 
- EE1, we find that most of our tentative theories are incorrect and there is a new explanation for the first problem we started on. 
- Through this natural selection process, we build new knowledge and end up with a new problem situation, PS2.

> PS1 -> TT1 -> EE1 -> PS2


## Thomas Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolution {.smaller}
- **Normal science**: general rules, laws and paradigms accepted as truths; does not aim to explore new ideas or build on scientific knowledge, experiment, or risk.
- **Paradigm**: an unchangeable pattern used over and over again; widely accepted by the scientific community.
- **Anomalies**: things that do not fit into the paradigms of normal science; happens once or twice and does not fit into commonly accepted patterns.
- **Crisis**: the accumulation of many anomalies against an accepted truth of normal science; encountered when normal science does not fit with reality anymore.
- **Revolution**: after a crisis, the revolution replaces the old paradigm with a new paradigm.
- **Paradigm shift**: when the widely accepted paradigm encounters many anomalies, leading to crisis, then revolution, and settles into a new paradigm, which becomes accepted and the new normal science.

# III. A Quick Look at Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods {background-color="aquamarine"}


## Qualitative Research
- Qualitative research aims at gaining insight and depth; not just simple facts, but insights, emotions, perspectives, and so on about the topic of research

::: {.callout-note}
## Deductive reasoning
Deductive reasoning begins with a broad theory that can lead to a specific idea or concept that is ready to be tested; data collection is straightforward with no digressions.
:::


## Quantitative Research
- Quantitative Research requires a good grasp of the topic of study and research conducted in that topic before data collection; the design of study is essential and their work is based on the systematic calculation of data

::: {.callout-note}
## Deductive reasoning
Deductive reasoning begins with a broad theory that can lead to a specific idea or concept that is ready to be tested; data collection is straightforward with no digressions.
:::


## Mixed Methods {.smaller}
- Mixed methods is a research design combine the best features of qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
- Mixed-method design is useful in studies when traditional qualitative or quantitative methods will leave the study with significant limitations.
- There are four most widely used types of mixed-methods:
  - **Convergent design** is used when the qualitative and quantitative data are collected simultaneously; the data is analyzed separately and only brought together when compiling results.
  - **Explanatory sequential design**
    - Quantitative lead design is a two-phase process that starts with quantitative data collection, followed by qualitative collection of cases important to the study.
    - Qualitative lead design is a two-phase data collection that starts with qualitative and then is followed by quantitative methods.
  - **Embedded design** is when one qualitative or quantitative study is ongoing and collects different types of data before, during, or after the study.


# IV. Ethical Research {background-color="aquamarine"}


## Ethics and Research Ethics
- **Ethics**: the group of morals and values that govern behaviors and decisions
- **Research ethics**: research ethics use rules and regulations concerned with protecting the rights of people who participate in research studies.


## Ethical Rules
- Informed consent provides participants with information about the study, particularly about any risks involved.
- Confidentiality is the promise not to disclose identifiable information about the participant to any third party.
- It is unethical to coerce people into taking part in a study
- Conflict of interest is also a concern; it refers to the possibility that the study may be part of an outside agenda.


## A Violation of Ethics

> The Tuskegee syphilis study is an infamous case of ethics violation in research.

- It started with...
  - Between 1932 and 1972, the United States Public Health Service
and the Tuskegee Institute conducted a study on the effects of syphilis on
the human body. 

---

- What happened?
  - The researchers recruited 600 African American men to participate, but did not disclose the focus of their study to their participants, who were simply told they were being treated for “bad blood.” 
  - Many believed they were receiving free health services from the government.
  - Two-thirds of the participating men had syphilis, and despite the fact that
penicillin was validated as an effective treatment in 1942, not one of the men in the Tuskegee study received treatment. 
  - This continued for an additional 30 years, and was finally revealed through a leak to the newspapers in the early 1970s. 

---

- What impact?
  - Only 74 participants survived. Around 40 of their wives were also infected and 19 children were born with syphilis (U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, 2013). 
  - The tragedy of the Tuskegee study is measured not only in numbers directly affected, but in the lasting resentment it caused within the African American community.

## Researchers’ Biases {.smaller}
- **Objectivity**: perceiving something from different angles without personal preferences or judgements.
- **Subjective thinking**: based on personal emotions, experiences, and prejudices.
- **Selective observation**: a common type of bias, when one is focused on a specific occurrence or group of people instead of including an entire sample of the observation; that is, focuses on what interests the researcher and failing to notice things that may contradict their theory.
- **Overconfidence bias**: when a researcher feels overconfident in their own abilities and does not consider additional details or aspect that could need more attention.
- **Overgeneralization**: using a small number of cases to draw conclusions about the entire population.

# Summary and Terms {background-color="aquamarine"}

::: {.notes}

- Scientific research seeks to produce reliable knowledge through systematic investigation, distinguishing it from traditional, authoritative, or experiential forms of knowledge. Unlike these forms, scientific knowledge is trusted because it is created using structured methods, clear rules, and rigorous analysis. Researchers aim to uncover objective truths, acknowledging that knowledge evolves over time as new insights emerge.

- Two key theories guide the advancement of scientific knowledge. Karl Popper’s principle of falsifiability argues that progress occurs when theories are systematically tested and proven wrong, relying on empirical evidence to refine or replace existing ideas. Meanwhile, Thomas Kuhn’s concept of scientific revolutions explains that science operates within established paradigms until anomalies accumulate, leading to a crisis and a paradigm shift. Over time, the new paradigm becomes the foundation for normal science, illustrating the dynamic nature of scientific progress.

- Research methods involve three primary approaches: qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Qualitative research emphasizes depth, seeking to explore emotions and perspectives using inductive reasoning. Quantitative research is more structured, employing deductive reasoning to test specific hypotheses using measurable data. Mixed methods combine the strengths of both, offering flexibility through designs like convergent or sequential approaches to address complex research questions.

- Ethics play a crucial role in research. Researchers must prioritize participant rights through informed consent, confidentiality, and avoidance of coercion or conflicts of interest. Historical cases like the Tuskegee syphilis study highlight the consequences of ethical violations. To maintain objectivity, researchers should avoid biases such as selective observation, overconfidence, and overgeneralization, striving for an unbiased pursuit of knowledge.

- Ultimately, scientific research thrives on ethics, objectivity, and the willingness to challenge established ideas. By adhering to these principles, researchers contribute to a constantly evolving body of knowledge that advances understanding and benefits society.
